            <h2>Week 1 - 8/30/19</h2>
                <h3>Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</h3>

                    <p>My first week was more than I expected.  Having worked with git during the intro class, I felt like I would be able to breeze through.  I learned way more than I expected especially how it is used within GitHub for collaboration.  The HTML and CSS are about what I expected.</p>
            
                <h3>What are you struggling with?</h3>

                    <p> Honestly, right now it is time. I have 2 weeks of work and the prework was a little more time consuming than I initially expected.  I just need to power through and wait until I can commit all my time to bootcamp.

                        At the time of this writing I am  working through a challenge in CSS with the card exercise.
                    </p>
            <h3>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h3>
                    <p>  I am very excited about Javascript and SQL as I have seen what these languages can do first hand at my current place of employment.
