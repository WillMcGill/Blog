            <h2>Week 1 - 8/30/19</h2>
                <h3>Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</h3>

                    <p>My first week was more than I expected.  Having worked with git during the intro class, I felt like I would be able to breeze through.  I learned way more than I expected especially how it is used within GitHub for collaboration.  The HTML and CSS are about what I expected.</p>
            
                <h3>What are you struggling with?</h3>

                    <p> Honestly, right now it is time. I have 2 weeks of work and the prework was a little more time consuming than I initially expected.  I just need to power through and wait until I can commit all my time to bootcamp.</p>
                        
                        <p>At the time of this writing I am  working through a challenge in CSS with the card exercise.</p>
                    
            <h3>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h3>
                    <p class = "answer">I am very excited about Javascript and SQL as I have seen what these languages can do first hand at my current place of employment.</p>
                        
                    <p>Baby steps.</p>

        <h2>Week 2 - 8/30/19</h2>
            <h3>What are your thoughts on Pseudo Coding?</h3>

                <p>At first it felt very tedious.  However, in conjuction with my "struggle" below, I began to understand it's relevance.  Without the proper planning by pseudo coding and/or diagramming you will probably waste hours down the line filling in the blanks you would have caught in the planning phase.</p>

            <h3>What are you struggling with?</h3>

                <p>I wouldn't call it a struggle, but I feel like there is always more information to add.  There are many small steps that I feel like I leave out.</p>
            
            <h3>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h3>

                <p>Javascript next week!!</p>

        <h2>Week 3 - 9/7/19</h2>
            <h3>What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and Javascript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?</h3>

                <p>For me the easiest way to wrap my head around each of these, is by thinking of the tech stack as a house.</p>
                <p>The HTML is the frame.  It's what holds everything together but the information it contains doesn't look very pretty.</p>
                <p>The CSS is the coat of paint and the aesthetic section of the stack.  It takes the information within the HTML and styles it in such a way as to increase the user experience.</p>
                <p>Finally, Javascript.  The plumbing and wiring of the house.  It is the moving parts that actually allow a webpage, or app, to function and perform tasks. Otherwise, we would be stuck with static information.</p>
