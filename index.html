            <h2>Week 1 (Pre-work)- 8/30/19</h2>
            <h3>Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</h3>

            <p>My first week was more than I expected. Having worked with git during the intro class, I felt like I
                would be able to breeze through. I learned way more than I expected especially how it is used within
                GitHub for collaboration. The HTML and CSS are about what I expected.</p>

            <h3>What are you struggling with?</h3>

            <p> Honestly, right now it is time. I have 2 weeks of work and the prework was a little more time consuming
                than I initially expected. I just need to power through and wait until I can commit all my time to
                bootcamp.</p>

            <p>At the time of this writing I am working through a challenge in CSS with the card exercise.</p>

            <h3>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h3>
            <p class="answer">I am very excited about Javascript and SQL as I have seen what these languages can do
                first hand at my current place of employment.</p>

            <p>Baby steps.</p>

            <h2>Week 2 (Pre-work)- 8/30/19</h2>
            <h3>What are your thoughts on Pseudo Coding?</h3>

            <p>At first it felt very tedious. However, in conjunction with my "struggle" below, I began to understand
                it's relevance. Without the proper planning by pseudo coding and/or diagramming you will probably waste
                hours down the line filling in the blanks you would have caught in the planning phase.</p>

            <h3>What are you struggling with?</h3>

            <p>I wouldn't call it a struggle, but I feel like there is always more information to add. There are many
                small steps that I feel like I leave out.</p>

            <h3>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h3>

            <p>Javascript next week!!</p>

            <hr>


            <h2>Week 3 (Pre-work) - 9/7/19</h2>
            <h3>What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and Javascript play in the process of rendering
                content and providing user experience?</h3>

            <p>For me the easiest way to wrap my head around each of these, is by thinking of the tech stack as a house.
            </p>
            <p>The HTML is the frame. It's what holds everything together but the information it contains doesn't look
                very pretty.</p>
            <p>The CSS is the coat of paint and the aesthetic section of the stack. It takes the information within the
                HTML and styles it in such a way as to increase the user experience.</p>
            <p>Finally, Javascript. The plumbing and wiring of the house. It is the moving parts that actually allow a
                webpage, or app, to function and perform tasks. Otherwise, we would be stuck with static information.
            </p>

            <h2>Week 4 (Pre-work) - 9/15/19</h2>
            <h3>What was one thing you liked and disliked about each of the new topics covered in Prework?</h3>

            <p>I liked all the topics covered in prework. Honestly, I was surprised that we have covered as much as we
                have. Javascript is a frustrating beast, but I am surprised that I have learned as much as I have
                remotely. I would say git could be a possible dislike, but relating to the collaboratory (is that a
                word?) functions of GitHub makes the whole process make more sense.</p>

            <h3>What was helpful?</h3>

            <p>Looking at other people's issues on Slack. So basically, my fellow bootcampers. </p>

            <h3>What hindered your progress?</h3>

            <p>It's an excuse that I'll no longer be able to use. My final week at work. I wish that I could have had a
                couple days in person at Awesome Inc.</p>
            <p>Scope. Placement of functions and the declaration of variables. This is not my strongest suit and
                something I need to study on.</p>

            <h3>How did you overcome challenges?</h3>

            <p>Google. LOL.</p>
            <p>Something that has hindered me before the class while doing research on my own has been researching and
                just copy and pasting. This time around I have made a conscious effort to not do so. Instead, reading
                the documentation and applying the code so that I understand what I am doing, not just doing something
                to make it work.</p>
            <p>But...I also think this makes my code "long winded" (if that's a thing). I'd like to work on making it
                more succinct.</p>

            <h2>Week 1 - 9/22/19</h2>
            <h3>What did you learn about that helped you understand more about Design?</h3>

            <p>The campaign website project was all about design. Making a project visually appealing, but equally
                important, technical functionality. Mobile first. While I do most of my web browsing on my cellphone, it
                was not my first thought to design my site for mobile first. Using Bootstrap was frustrating at first,
                and still is in some aspects. However, little by little, as I figure out to how to make certain tweaks
                it is obvious why the framework as a whole is a timesaver and a great way to make websites for every
                device.</p>

            <h3>What was helpful?</h3>

            <p>Looking at other people's issues on Slack. So basically, my fellow bootcampers. </p>

            <h3>What do you want to continue learning about that helps you understand Design better?</h3>

            <p>I love technical things. But design is not my strongest attribute. Any principles that are common among
                physical and digital designs would be helpful. Something I can actively improve upon on are the CRAP
                principles presented by Jaqueline.</p>
            <p>Contrast</p>
            <p>Repetition</p>
            <p>Alignment</p>
            <p>Proximity</p>
            </br>
            <p>And a personal one.  Use of a wider range of colors.</p>

            <h3>What Design aspects are important to you as a user and as a developer?</h3>

            <p>As a User - If I have to spend more than a couple minutes searching a website for specific information.  I leave.  The shorter answer is the UI.  Is it intuitive and easy to use.  I'm probably using my phone and does the site resemble a usable app.</p>
            <p>As a developer - Same as above.  But making sure the information provided is correct.  Creating the site in a way that is scalable with constant change.  Can the client make easy changes? It would be important to use a framework that is widely accepted.  It does no good if the information is correct, but many users cannot access it in a digestible format.</p>
